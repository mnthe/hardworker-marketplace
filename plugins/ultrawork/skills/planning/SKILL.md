# Planning Protocol

## Overview

Define how to analyze context, make design decisions, and decompose work into tasks.

**Two modes:**
- **Interactive**: Orchestrator conducts Deep Interview for decisions
- **Auto**: Planner agent makes decisions based on context alone (--auto or --skip-interview)

---

## Phase 1: Read Context

Read session files in order:
1. `session.json` - goal and metadata
2. `context.json` - summary, key files, patterns from explorers
3. `exploration/*.md` - detailed findings as needed

---

## Phase 2: Complexity Analysis

Analyze goal and context to determine interview depth:

| Complexity | Files | Keywords | Impact | Rounds |
|------------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| trivial | 1-2 | fix, typo, add | None | 1 (4-5 Q) |
| standard | 3-5 | implement, create | Single module | 2 (8-10 Q) |
| complex | 6-10 | refactor, redesign | Multi-module | 3 (12-15 Q) |
| massive | 10+ | migrate, rewrite | Entire system | 4 (16-20 Q) |

**Note**: User can request more rounds via adaptive check. No upper limit.

---

## Phase 3: Deep Interview (Interactive Mode)

**Skip if**: `--auto` or `--skip-interview` flag set

### Interview Structure

Each round asks 4-5 questions using AskUserQuestion (max 4 questions per call).

### Context-Aware Options (CRITICAL)

**Options marked `[...]` MUST be generated from exploration context, NOT generic templates.**

See `references/context-aware-options.md` for:
- Generation process from context.json and exploration/*.md
- Option generation rules by question type
- Context-aware vs generic examples
- Validation checklist

### Interview Rounds

Rounds are adjusted based on complexity assessment:

| Complexity | Rounds | Focus Areas |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| trivial | 1 | Intent, Scope, Success criteria |
| standard | 2 | + Technical decisions (arch, tech stack, testing) |
| complex | 3 | + Edge cases, errors, concurrency, performance |
| massive | 4 | + UI/UX, observability, documentation, deployment |

**Note**: User can request additional rounds via adaptive check. No upper limit.

See `references/interview-rounds.md` for:
- Detailed question templates for each round
- Domain-specific question templates
- Adaptive check pattern
- Decision recording format

---

## Phase 4: Document Design

**IMPORTANT: Design documents go to PROJECT directory.**

```bash
WORKING_DIR=$(bun $SCRIPTS/session-get.js --session {SESSION_ID} --field working_dir)
DESIGN_PATH="$WORKING_DIR/docs/plans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-{goal-slug}-design.md"
```

Write comprehensive design.md including:
- Overview and approach selection
- **Interview decisions with rationale** (from Phase 3)
- Architecture and components
- Error handling strategy
- Testing strategy
- Scope (in/out)

See `references/design-template.md` for complete template.

---

## Phase 5: Decompose Tasks

### Task Guidelines

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Granularity** | One deliverable, ~30 min work, testable |
| **Complexity** | `standard` (sonnet) for CRUD/simple; `complex` (opus) for architecture/security |
| **Dependencies** | Independent `[]`, Sequential `["1"]`, Multi `["1","2"]`, Verify `[all]` |

### Create Tasks with Scripts

Use `task-create.js` for each task. Always include a final verify task.

See `references/task-examples.md` for:
- Complete script command examples
- Task decomposition patterns by feature type
- Dependency graph examples

---

## Output Summary

Return planning summary with:
- Complexity assessment and interview rounds completed
- Key decisions from interview (table format)
- Task graph showing IDs, subjects, dependencies, complexity
- Files created (design doc, task files)

---

## Flag Reference

| Flag | Effect on Interview |
|------|---------------------|
| (default) | Full Deep Interview based on complexity |
| `--skip-interview` | Skip interview, use ad-hoc AskUserQuestion as needed |
| `--auto` | Skip interview, auto-decide all choices |
