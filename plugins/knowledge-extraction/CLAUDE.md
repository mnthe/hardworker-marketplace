# knowledge-extraction

Node.js-based plugin for collecting and extracting insights from Claude sessions.

## Key Concepts

- **Session-based Isolation**: Each Claude session stores insights separately
- **Insight Format**: Uses `★ Insight` markers (Claude's existing format)
- **Auto-classification**: Insights categorized by type (code-pattern, workflow, debugging, architecture, tool-usage)
- **Extraction Targets**: Skills, Commands, Agents, CLAUDE.md

## File Structure

- `skills/insight-awareness/` - Skill for recognizing and saving insights
- `commands/insights.md` - `/insights` command for viewing/extracting
- `agents/insight-extractor.md` - Agent for analyzing and converting insights
- `src/hooks/` - Node.js hook scripts
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Hook configuration

## Runtime Storage

```
.claude/knowledge-extraction/
├── config.local.md              # Settings (threshold, auto_recommend, output_dir)
└── sessions/
    └── {session-id}.md          # Per-session insights (deleted after extraction)
```

## Hook Configuration

Hooks use Node.js with explicit `node` prefix for cross-platform compatibility:

```json
"command": "node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/src/hooks/check-insights.js"
```
