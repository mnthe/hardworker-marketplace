# Documentation Standards

**Source of Truth**: Both (this file for detailed standards, CLAUDE.md for overview)
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-16

## Documentation Discipline

**Goal**: High-value, verifiable documentation. Avoid low-ROI documentation.

## Documentation Categories

### Mandatory (auto-generated, verifiable)

- API contracts, type signatures
- CHANGELOG from commits

### Conditional (high-value, needs review)

- README structure updates
- Architecture decisions (ADR)

### Prohibited (negative ROI)

- Inline comments restating code
- Duplicate explanations
- Unrequested documentation files

### Autonomous (agent decides)

- Tone, format, examples
- Level of detail

## Evidence-Based Language

### Forbidden Phrases

Never use speculation in output:
- "may"
- "could"
- "seems"
- "probably"
- "should work"
- "basic implementation"
- "you can extend this"
- "TODO" / "FIXME" (in final output)

### Required Evidence

Claims must be backed by proof:
- "Fixed" → Show test passes, error gone
- "Works" → Demonstrate execution
- "Complete" → All acceptance criteria met

## Command Specification

Command files (`commands/*.md`) must include:

```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: One-line description
args: "optional arguments spec"
---

# Command Title

## Overview

## Usage
\`\`\`
/command-name [options]
\`\`\`

## Options
- `--option`: Description

## Workflow
Step-by-step execution flow.
```

## Agent Specification

Agent files (`agents/*/AGENT.md`) must include:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Agent role description
tools: [list, of, allowed, tools]
---

# Agent Role

## Purpose
Why this agent exists.

## Responsibilities

## CLAUDE.md Usage

CLAUDE.md files provide context to AI agents.

| Level   | Location                           | Purpose                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Root    | `/CLAUDE.md`                       | Project overview, guidelines |
| Plugin  | `/plugins/*/CLAUDE.md`             | Plugin-specific context      |
| Agent   | `/plugins/*/agents/*/CLAUDE.md`    | Agent role context           |
| Session | `~/.claude/*/sessions/*/CLAUDE.md` | Session activity             |
